# Progress So Far

## Designing the new Landing Page
built a basic template with static images, based on what I have available through the different APIs.
Now in the process of hooking up the Spotify/LastFM section, as that is going to be the easiest to complete.

I created a basic static template to work on

To be creative, I wanted to ensure the client retrieves all of their information from my site database, as a pose to the live APIs its connecting to.
i wanted to do this because some APIs only allow you to make a certain amount of requests every hour/day/month. Having the APIs called at specific intervals bypasses the potential of site clients themselves running my API connections into the ground with their traffic.
I got this idea looking into an MEVN stack using Nuxt.js, which I may move on to for a future project.



Added CRON tasks for collecting the information on an interval.

I provide the CRON task manager with an expression (defining how often the task runs, in this instance Once every 60 seconds)
I also give it the command which the system uses to identify the hard-coded function
It is also possible to pass a data POJO but this is for the future.

By the end of the day I was able get the basic javascript fetch code installed in two seperate ways
- Spotify widget calls directly from /apps/spotify/data (fetch method)
- last.fm widget is updated on page refresh (EJS method)
