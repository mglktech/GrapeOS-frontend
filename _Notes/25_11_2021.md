## changes
- Made modifications to the Discord Strategy, so it saves your discord information to the database and creates a new user.
- It validates your User account with the GrapeOS Discord Server and checks to see if you have the Superuser tag.
- It then updates the database based on information collected at that moment, syncronising a user's permissions *before* redirecting the client.
- SO if you've gained access to a certain part of the site while you were offline, you'll have access to it as soon as you log in again.
